# Class and Event Permutation Calculator

## Doing all of the planning for you

###### What will the application do?  Who will use it?
The main objective of this project is for a user to input all 
subevents/classes that they wish to take (along their respective possible times), 
and to then receive all possible schedules possible from such combinations. 
The project should be able to apply tags to the events for increased functionality;
Example: 
1) The user can state that if one specific event takes place,
another specific event in their list shouldn't be placed.
2) Placing event/class priority, so possible schedules with those preferences should 
be listed first

###### Why is this project of Interest to you?  
Planning for a specific class schedule can take a while, and making several of them is 
a tedious task. Similarly, if a class fills up while you are registering can make it
really hard to switch things around if you didn't plan for a specific thing to happen. 
This project will help with that, allowing me to **instantly** apply *filters* to 
know what my  possible options are. Such a project can also be **generalized** to event 
planning where you might want multiple things to happen at a specific panel, but can't
 have them all at the same time.
